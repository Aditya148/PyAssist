## Getting Started  
A Personal Project

### Prerequisite Packages
The most important package is PyAudio which we will be using to detect our voice via mic.
To install <b>PyAudio</b> you may face difficulty by installing it directly via 'pip install pyaudio'. So here is an alternate way.
* Download the .whl file of PyAudio package for your specific Python Version. In this project I have used <b>Python 3.7</b> and my <b>OS is 64-bit</b>, so I'll provide the specific file in this repo for python version 3.7 :-<br><br>
<b>PyAudio WHL File:</b> https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/ <br>
`Search for the file: PyAudio‑0.2.11‑cp37‑cp37m‑win_amd64.whl` <br><br>
* Install PyAudio using WHL File:-<br><br>
`Go to the directory where whl file is present and open command prompt and run: `<br><b>pip install PyAudio‑0.2.11‑cp37‑cp37m‑win_amd64.whl</b>
